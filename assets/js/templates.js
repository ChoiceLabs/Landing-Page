Applicable Law; Arbitration</h3>\n\n<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION (JURY TRIAL WAIVER) OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES (OTHER THAN SPECIFIED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS AND SMALL CLAIMS) WITH CHOICE AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM CHOICE (NO CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS). \n<span style=\"bold\">You and Choice agree to waive any right to a jury trial, or the right to have any Dispute resolved in any court, and instead accept the use of binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more impartial persons for a final and binding determination); provided, however, that you have the right to litigate any Dispute in small claims court, if all the requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the Dispute, are satisfied. You agree to bring a Dispute in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or, if you reside in the U.S., in a small claims court in your county of residence. “Dispute”</span> as used in this Section 15 means any dispute, cause of action, claim, or controversy arising out of or in any way related to Choice, these Terms, the subject matter of these Terms, or access to and use of the Services, including but not limited to personal injury disputes and disputes that involve third parties (such as developers of Content), except any dispute, cause of action, claim, or controversy relating to your or Choice’s intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and/or patents). </p>\n\n<p><span class=\"bold\"> You and Choice agree that any Dispute is personal to you and Choice, and that any Dispute shall only be resolved by an individual arbitration and shall not be brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any other representative proceeding. Neither party agrees to class arbitration, or an arbitration where a person brings a Dispute as a representative of any other person or persons. Neither you nor Choice agree that a Dispute can be brought as a class or representative action whether inside or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other person or persons. </span></p>\n\n<p>You and Choice agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of Section 14 shall be governed by, construed, and enforced, both substantively and procedurally, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. </p>\n\n<p>The arbitrator, Choice, and you shall maintain the confidentiality of any proceedings, including but not limited to, any and all information gathered, prepared, and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator shall have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard that confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. </p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to resolve claims fairly and quickly. Accordingly, for any Dispute that you have against Choice, you agree to first contact Choice and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Choice. The Notice to Choice must be sent by certified mail addressed to: Choice Labs, Inc., 300 Brannan Street, Suite 308, San Francisco, CA 94107.  The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, and the email address and/or mobile telephone number associated with your account; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. If you and Choice cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after such Notice is received, then either party may, as appropriate in accordance with this Section 14, commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in court. You and Choice agree that any Dispute must be commenced or filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred. </p>\n\n<p>In the event that you and Choice cannot resolve a Dispute and you do not pursue your claims through small claims court, you or Choice shall promptly submit the Dispute to binding arbitration at the office of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). In the event AAA declines or is unable to administer the arbitration, you and Choice agree to use an arbitration forum or arbitrator that you and Choice mutually agree upon. If, after making a reasonable effort, you and Choice are not able to agree upon an arbitration forum or arbitrator, AAA or a court having proper jurisdiction will appoint an arbitration forum or arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules“”) then in effect. The AAA Rules and other information about AAA and arbitration are readily available at http://www.adr.org, by calling 1-800-778-7879, or by mail at 120 Broadway, Floor 21, New York, NY 10271. By entering into these Terms, you either (1) acknowledge that you have read and understand the AAA Rules or (2) waive reading the AAA Rules and waive any claim that the AAA Rules are unfair in any way. You and Choice agree that these Terms govern the arbitration, and that the applicable AAA Rules shall be subject to changes in procedures that AAA may make from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the applicable AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the exclusive power and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions concerning the Dispute; provided, however, that this power does not include: (i) the power to determine the question of arbitrability, which power you and Choice agree shall be vested solely in a court of competent jurisdiction; or (ii) the power to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms (as stated above). The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration, and may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding, or any proceeding on behalf of or involving more than one person or persons. </p>\n\n<p>This dispute resolution provision in Section 15 shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>\n\n<h3>15.   Termination </h3>\n\n<p>Choice reserves the right to suspend, remove, discontinue, disable your access to the Services at any time and without notice you. Further, either party may terminate these Terms at any time immediately upon notice to the other party. In no event will Choice be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any portion or feature of the Services or for terminating these Terms. Upon termination of these Terms, all licenses granted to you will terminate, you will cease and remove all uses of Downloadable Content, and you will stop using the Services. Upon termination of these Terms, Sections 3 (only the first paragraph), 5, and 9-18 of these Terms will survive.</p>\n\n<h3>16.   Severability </h3>\n\n<p>If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. </p>\n\n<h3>17.   Assignment</h3>\n\n<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms to a third party, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Choice, and any attempted assignment without such consent will be void. Choice may freely assign or transfer these Terms to a third party. Subject to the foregoing restriction on you, these Terms will be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns.</p>\n\n<h3>18.

Applicable Law; Arbitration</h3>\n\n<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO SUBMIT TO BINDING ARBITRATION (JURY TRIAL WAIVER) OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES (OTHER THAN SPECIFIED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS AND SMALL CLAIMS) WITH CHOICE AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM CHOICE (NO CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS OR ARBITRATIONS). \n<span style=\"font-weight: bold\">You and Choice agree to waive any right to a jury trial, or the right to have any Dispute resolved in any court, and instead accept the use of binding arbitration (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more impartial persons for a final and binding determination); provided, however, that you have the right to litigate any Dispute in small claims court, if all the requirements of the small claims court, including any limitations on jurisdiction and the amount at issue in the Dispute, are satisfied. You agree to bring a Dispute in small claims court in San Francisco County, California or, if you reside in the U.S., in a small claims court in your county of residence. “Dispute”</span> as used in this Section 15 means any dispute, cause of action, claim, or controversy arising out of or in any way related to Choice, these Terms, the subject matter of these Terms, or access to and use of the Services, including but not limited to personal injury disputes and disputes that involve third parties (such as developers of Content), except any dispute, cause of action, claim, or controversy relating to your or Choice’s intellectual property (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and/or patents). </p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: bold\"> You and Choice agree that any Dispute is personal to you and Choice, and that any Dispute shall only be resolved by an individual arbitration and shall not be brought as a class arbitration, a class action, or any other representative proceeding. Neither party agrees to class arbitration, or an arbitration where a person brings a Dispute as a representative of any other person or persons. Neither you nor Choice agree that a Dispute can be brought as a class or representative action whether inside or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other person or persons. </span></p>\n\n<p>You and Choice agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and that the enforceability of Section 14 shall be governed by, construed, and enforced, both substantively and procedurally, by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (“FAA”) to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. </p>\n\n<p>The arbitrator, Choice, and you shall maintain the confidentiality of any proceedings, including but not limited to, any and all information gathered, prepared, and presented for purposes of the arbitration or related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator shall have the authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard that confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary. </p>\n\n<p>Our goal is to resolve claims fairly and quickly. Accordingly, for any Dispute that you have against Choice, you agree to first contact Choice and attempt to resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your claim (“Notice”) to Choice. The Notice to Choice must be sent by certified mail addressed to: Choice Labs, Inc., 300 Brannan Street, Suite 308, San Francisco, CA 94107.  The Notice must (a) include your name, residence address, and the email address and/or mobile telephone number associated with your account; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought. If you and Choice cannot reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after such Notice is received, then either party may, as appropriate in accordance with this Section 14, commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in court. You and Choice agree that any Dispute must be commenced or filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the Dispute is permanently barred. </p>\n\n<p>In the event that you and Choice cannot resolve a Dispute and you do not pursue your claims through small claims court, you or Choice shall promptly submit the Dispute to binding arbitration at the office of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). In the event AAA declines or is unable to administer the arbitration, you and Choice agree to use an arbitration forum or arbitrator that you and Choice mutually agree upon. If, after making a reasonable effort, you and Choice are not able to agree upon an arbitration forum or arbitrator, AAA or a court having proper jurisdiction will appoint an arbitration forum or arbitrator. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules“”) then in effect. The AAA Rules and other information about AAA and arbitration are readily available at http://www.adr.org, by calling 1-800-778-7879, or by mail at 120 Broadway, Floor 21, New York, NY 10271. By entering into these Terms, you either (1) acknowledge that you have read and understand the AAA Rules or (2) waive reading the AAA Rules and waive any claim that the AAA Rules are unfair in any way. You and Choice agree that these Terms govern the arbitration, and that the applicable AAA Rules shall be subject to changes in procedures that AAA may make from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>As limited by the FAA, these Terms, and the applicable AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the exclusive power and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive decisions concerning the Dispute; provided, however, that this power does not include: (i) the power to determine the question of arbitrability, which power you and Choice agree shall be vested solely in a court of competent jurisdiction; or (ii) the power to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by these Terms (as stated above). The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration, and may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding, or any proceeding on behalf of or involving more than one person or persons. </p>\n\n<p>This dispute resolution provision in Section 15 shall survive termination of these Terms.</p>\n\n<h3>15.   Termination </h3>\n\n<p>Choice reserves the right to suspend, remove, discontinue, disable your access to the Services at any time and without notice you. Further, either party may terminate these Terms at any time immediately upon notice to the other party. In no event will Choice be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any portion or feature of the Services or for terminating these Terms.

Upon termination of these Terms, Sections 3 (only the first paragraph), 5, and 9-18 of these Terms will survive.</p>\n\n<h3>16.   Severability </h3>\n\n<p>If any provision of these Terms shall be deemed unlawful, void or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these Terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. </p>\n\n<h3>17.   Assignment</h3>\n\n<p>You may not assign or transfer these Terms to a third party, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Choice, and any attempted assignment without such consent will be void. Choice may freely assign or transfer these Terms to a third party. Subject to the foregoing restriction on you, these Terms will be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns.</p>\n\n<h3>18.
